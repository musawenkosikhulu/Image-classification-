# Image-classification-
In this project we created a convolutional neural network model to deal with colour image classification with 10 classes. we did one-hot encode the targets for this data set and we got the dimensions of the resulting vector 10 using soft-max activation function. We then plotted Training Performance using the accuracy vs. epoch of the model; The accuracy was 65%.
